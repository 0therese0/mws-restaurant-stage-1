#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Delivery

Restaurant reviews application with a focus on mobile rendering with accessibility. The application must include a local node server and client app to support authentication, restaurant names, a photograph, address and operating hours for each restaurant along with reviews, including the name of the reviewer, date of review, 5-star rating system, and comments. The application must include an application header, a menu providing multiple ways to filter the restaurants. When viewing a specific restaurant, current reviews must be displayed along with a form for the user to submit their own review.

_*Development will focus on local engineering sandbox. Files, resources, and server side services will run on the users local machine._
